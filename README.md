NFCopy Project

More than four years ago, someone was able to implement MSD for Android: https://github.com/dimalinux/SwipeYours. I implemented the same ideology to emulate a contactless transaction with the Acr122u NFC reader using the RFIDIOt library(https://github.com/AdamLaurie/RFIDIOt) from Adam Laurie(https://rfidiot.org). 

The code only contains the feature to replay a constant value, so researchers could have the opportunity to emulate prepared cards for educational purposes. I did not add the reading part to avoid fraudulent transactions.
